/*
WHAT IS REDUX? 

1. Redux is a state management library. When we say state, we mean the same state we have used so far.
We are going to make redux in charge of handling data inside our applications. 
2. Redux makes creating complex applications a little bit easier. 
3. We don't have to use redux on every project that we work on!
4. The redux library itself is not designed just to work with REACT.

/*
REDUX BY ANALOGY

Redux Cycle

Action Creator -> Action -> Dispatch -> Reducers -> State. 

Analogy 

We are going to build an insurance company. 

- Customers hold a "policy", if bad stuff happens to them then they are payed money.
- a "claim", is something a customer files to an insurance company. They do this to get some money from an insurance company.
